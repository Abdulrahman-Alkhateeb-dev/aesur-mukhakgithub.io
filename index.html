        <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business. We share your Information only as described below and with businesses that follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Other Businesses.</strong> To offer you our Services, we may engage with businesses who are affiliates of us and/or non-affiliated service providers (e.g. logistics businesses used to deliver products to you, marketing companies, payments processors to process online transactions, etc.). We may involve other businesses in your transactions, who may store your Information in a digital wallet to make your use of our Services more efficient.
            You understand that it is important that such businesses have access to the relevant Information to perform their functions. We will ensure that these businesses do not use your Information for other purposes. We may also receive Information from these businesses (e.g. updated delivery and address information), which we may use (e.g. to correct our records and deliver your next purchase). By using our Platform, you hereby freely and specifically consent to the transfer, storage, use, and disclosure of your Information among businesses who are affiliates of us and/or non-affiliated service providers, wherever located. These businesses shall be contractually bound to respect the confidentiality of your Information.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Marketing and Promotional Offers.</strong> We may also use your Information to provide you with information about goods and services which may be of interest to you and enhance your Platform experience, service messages, new features, enhancements, special offers, and events of interest. We may contact you via various channels, including without limitation emails, push notifications, web notifications, posts, telephone, in-app messages, and news feed cards.
            We may permit third parties to use your Information. For example, we may provide advertisers with Information to help them reach the kind of audience they want to target and to enable us to comply with our commitments to our advertisers (e.g. by displaying their advertisements to a target audience).
            Additionally, you may be asked to provide additional information to participate in some of our market research activities, including competitions and promotions. For example, if you win a competition, you may be asked to provide further personal data to establish your eligibility and provide you with the prize. This information may be collected by us or our co-sponsors or vendors for the promotion. Note that you should review such third-party privacy policies to see how they may use any information that they collect.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> In the event that we or substantially all of our assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Protection of Our Platform and Others.</strong> We release account and other Information when we believe such a release is appropriate to comply with the law and law enforcement investigations and to protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for various reasons, such as fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
            Note that our Platform may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers, and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data or other information to these websites.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>The information that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at, a destination outside of the UAE. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the UAE who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details, and the provision of support services.</p>
        <p>We will store your Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted or required by law. Your Information may be transferred, stored, processed, and used by our affiliated companies and/or non-affiliated service providers in one or more countries outside your originating country. Your payment details may be transferred to and stored with our affiliated companies in order to, among other things, process your payment details and provide support services to you.</p>
        
        <h2>WHAT SECURITY MEASURES WE APPLY</h2>
        <p>We maintain commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to ensure your Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and to protect against unauthorized access or alteration to, disclosure, or destruction of your Information.

Only authorized employees, contractors, and agents who need to know your Information in connection with the performance of their services are allowed to access this Information.</p>
        <p>It is important for you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password and to your devices used to access our Services. You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. For example, ensure that you sign off when you have finished using a shared device.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Information transmitted to our Platform and any transmission is at your own risk.</p>
        
        <h2>HOW CAN YOU ACCESS AND AMEND YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

        <h2>WHAT IF WE CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY?</h2>
        <p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy may therefore also need to change.
